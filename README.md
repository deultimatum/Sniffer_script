# Sniffer_script
This script will take sniffer dongle name automatically which are connected and set it in monitor mode.
It will ask user input for channels or running two channels.
I will automatically run wireshark after setting the dongle to monitor mode.
i will add 2 scripts:
1. It will run sniffer with one dongle.
2. It will run sniffer with 2 sniffer dongles.
